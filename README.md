# Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown

This is a Power BI file where I created a dashboard for the data professionals Survey.
Firstly, I took the data into Excel and transformed it into a Power BI query Editor where I made changes accordingly.
For Example: 
1) Changing the date format
2) Using Average Salary because the data was given in a range
3) Filtering out some options of others with the given options using Delimiter etc

Then Into the report view, the first I did was add a title while formatting the size and fonts.
1) The first chart is a Tree Chart based on countries.
2) The second chart below is a Stacked Column Chart that has the information based on the favorite programming language against survey takers but I also added a legend of 
   the Job Title where we could see that Python is most favorite programming language.
3) The third chart is the Donut Chart which shows the average salary based on gender where we can see both gender earns almost equally.
4) The fourth chart is also a stacked bar chart that has the average salary against the job title where we can see which job title can earn more salary.
5) The Fifth and Sixth are Cards which has the total number of survey takers and their average age respectively.
6) The Seventh and the Eighth charts are Gauge charts where we can see their happiness with Work/Life/Balance and happiness with Salary. The first gauge shows that they are 
   happy with Work/Life/Balance because it shows more than half a meter, but the second guage shows below the meter where they are not happy with salary. 

The final theme I added was from the View tab which had some variety of color options.
